<p>Emre Dayangac is a rising senior at Hisar School in Istanbul, Turkey. As a prominent member IdeaLab Fablab, Emre leads research initiatives focusing on digital fabrication and human-computer interaction. He has developed significant expertise working with augmented reality (AR) applications integrated with mechanical systems, implementing solutions using the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework to create responsive and interactive environments.

<br><br>
At the lab, Emre combines computational design with physical fabrication, exploring how AR interfaces can enhance interaction with mechanical prototypes. His projects have included developing AR visualizations for robotic systems and creating intuitive interfaces for complex fabrication processes. Through his work with ROS, he has gained experience in real-time control systems, sensor integration, and human-machine interfaces.

<br><br>
Emre is planning to study Computer Science at university, where he hopes to further explore the intersection of mixed reality technologies, robotic systems, and human-centered design. His multidisciplinary approach bridges software development, mechanical engineering, and interactive design to create innovative solutions for future computing paradigms.
